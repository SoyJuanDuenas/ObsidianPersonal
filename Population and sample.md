#inferential_statistics

 
A population is a set of people or objects that have common characteristics that we are interested in study and a sample is a subset of the population. Now usually We don't have access to population data just sample data, for this reason we have to use sample statistics as point estimates for unknow population parameters.

The number of elements of the sample are called sample size, and if our sample contains all elements of the population we called it census, 

Normally we should work with a [[representative sample]] of the population, this can be achieved using sampling, in this framework we will use only numerical variables

Usually sample statistics vary sample to sample, quantifying [[sample and sampling distributions]] provides us a way to estimate the margin of error associated with our point estimate.
