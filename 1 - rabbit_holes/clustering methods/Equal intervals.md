The equal interval (or equal step) clustering problem method divides the range of attribute values into equally sized classes. The number of classes is determined by the user. The equal interval classification method is best used for continuous datasets such as precipitation or temperature.

This method emphasizes the amount of an attribute value relative to other values. For example, it shows that a shop is part of the group of shops that make up the top one-third of all sales. The advantage of the equal interval classification method is that it creates a legend that is easy to interpret and present to a nontechnical audience. The primary disadvantage is that certain datasets will end up with most of the data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will occupy the other classes. that is because outlier values have a big effect on this option.
