The standard deviation [[clustering problem]] method forms each class by adding and subtracting the standard deviation from the mean of the dataset. The method is best suited to be used with data that conforms to a normal distribution.

This is a useful method when trying to get more fine-grained in understanding how quickly your data deviates from the mean on the map. But, the legend is mostly unintelligible to most people, because it no longer shows the actual percentages. Consider your audience before showing them a thematic map with this legend.
