An algorithm is a tool in **Computer Science** to solve problems in the real life. An algorithm is correct if each input is related with a correct output, but also, exists algorithms that are partially correct because not all the inputs are related with a correct output. An algorithm can be defined also as a set of  finite and mathematically rigorous instructions or steps to transform a input into a output.

The speed is the measure of an algorithm, we can measure this with [[computational complexity]]

The study of algorithms not depends on the computers
