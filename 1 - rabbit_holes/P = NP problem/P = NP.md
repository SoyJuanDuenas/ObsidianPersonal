**P vs. NP** is one of the most fundamental open questions in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time (NP) can also be solved in polynomial time (P). Formally, it seeks to determine whether [[P = NP]].

The **P vs. NP** problem encapsulates the core challenges of computational theory, shaping our understanding of efficiency, feasibility, and the power of algorithms. Solving it would revolutionize science, technology, and mathematics, making it one of the most profound questions in human knowledge.

### Key Concepts

1. **[[P - Problems]] (Polynomial Time)**:
    - The class of problems solvable by a deterministic [[Turing machine]] in polynomial time.
    - These problems are considered "efficiently solvable."
2. ** [[NP - Problems]] (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)**:
    - The class of problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic [[Turing machine]].
    - Solutions may not be efficiently computable, but their correctness can be quickly confirmed.
3. **The Core Question**:
    
    - Are all problems that are "verifiable" in polynomial time also "solvable" in polynomial time?
    - If P = NP, then every NP problem can be efficiently solved.
