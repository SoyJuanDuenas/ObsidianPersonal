When we have a log Lin [[regression model]] where the dependent variable is in logarithmic form but the independent variable is not, the [[coefficient]] $\beta$ represents a **proportional** change in the dependent variable due to a one-unit change in the independent variable.

However, to interpret this change in percentage terms, we should apply the following formula

$$100×(exp(β)−1)$$
This gives us the **approximate percentage change** in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. For example:

if $\beta = 0.1$, then $100 \times \left( \exp(0.1) - 1 \right) \approx 10.52\%$, meaning that a one-unit increase in the independent variable is associated with an approximate 10.52% increase in the dependent variable.
