We have already seen the modeling power of [[OOP in python]] using the class and object functions by combining data and methods. There are three more important concept, **inheritance**, which makes the OOP code more modular, easier to reuse and build a relationship between classes. **Encapsulation** can hide some of the private details of a class from other objects, while **polymorphism** can allow us to use a common operation in different ways.
