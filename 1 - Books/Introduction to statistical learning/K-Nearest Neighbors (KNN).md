**k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** is a [[non-parametric method]] that predicts an outcome for a point $x_0$ using the outcomes of the $k$ most similar training points to $x_0$ under a chosen distance metric.

Low K elections will make a very flexible model with low [[bias]] but very high [[variance]], instead high elections of K will make less flexible models with high [[bias]] but low [[variance]]
