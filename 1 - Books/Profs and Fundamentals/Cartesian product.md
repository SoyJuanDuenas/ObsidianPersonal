## Definition

The **Cartesian Product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ is an element of $A$ and $b$ is an element of $B$.

## Notation

The Cartesian Product of sets $A$ and $B$ is denoted as:
$$A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$$

## Examples

### Example 1: Cartesian Product of  $\{1, 2\}$ and $\{a, b\}$

Let's consider the sets $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{a, b\}$.

The Cartesian Product $A \times B$ is:  $A \times B = \{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)\}$

### Example 2: Cartesian Product of $\{x, y\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3\}$

For the sets $A = \{x, y\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$:

The Cartesian Product $A \times B$ is: $A \times B = \{(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)\}$

## Properties

1. **Cardinality**: If $|A| = m$ and $|B| = n$, then $|A \times B| = m \times n$.
2. **Non-commutativity**: $A \times B \neq B \times A$ in general, unless $A = B$.
3. **Associativity**: $A \times (B \times C)$ is not the same as $(A \times B) \times C$, but there is an isomorphism between them.
4. **Distributivity**: $A \times (B \cup C) = (A \times B) \cup (A \times C)$.
## Construction

To construct the Cartesian Product of sets $A$ and $B$:

1. Take each element $a$ in $A$.
2. Pair $a$ with each element $b$ in $B$.
3. Form the ordered pair $(a, b)$.
4. Repeat for all elements in $A$.
## Applications

Cartesian Products have applications in various fields including:

1. **Mathematics**: Used in defining relations, functions, and multi-dimensional spaces.
2. **Computer Science**: Important in database theory, data structures, and algorithm design.
3. **Geometry**: Used to define coordinate systems and shapes in multi-dimensional spaces.
4. **Logic**: Used in the study of product spaces and relations between sets.
