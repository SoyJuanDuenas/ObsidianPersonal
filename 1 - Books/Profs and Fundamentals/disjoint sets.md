## Definition 

Disjoint sets are sets that have no elements in common. In set theory, disjoint sets are the same as [[mutually exclusive events]], but the term is more commonly used outside of probability theory. a graphical view of this if the following

# Formal Definition

Two sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint if:

$$A \cap B = \emptyset$$
Following the last definition we can generalize it for $n$ number of sets. If 
$$\bigcap_{i =1}^{n}A_i = \emptyset$$Then the sets are disjoint

### Examples

- **Number Sets**: The set of even numbers $\{2, 4, 6, \ldots\}$ and the set of odd numbers $\{1, 3, 5, \ldots\}$ are disjoint because no number can be both even and odd.
- **Venn Diagram**: In a Venn diagram, two circles that do not overlap represent disjoint sets.
## Key Differences

- **Terminology**: The term "[[mutually exclusive events]]" is typically used in probability theory to describe some type of relation between events, while "disjoint" is more commonly used in set theory and other areas of mathematics to describe sets.
- **Context**: "[[Mutually exclusive events]]" often refers to events that cannot occur at the same time in a probabilistic context, while "disjoint" refers to sets with no common elements in a broader mathematical context.
