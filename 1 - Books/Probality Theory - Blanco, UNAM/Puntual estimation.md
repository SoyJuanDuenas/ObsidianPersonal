#inferential_statistics 

As we say in [[Population and sample]] we are interested in study numerical characteristic of a population, this characteristic is called variable, if we take a random sample of the population the characteristic of interest will become into a [[random variable]]. 


> [!NOTE] Title
> Be $X$ a [[random variable]] with a know density function (or a probability distribution) $f(x;\theta)$, but  dependent of a unknow $\theta$ parameter (or vector parameter)

We want to estimate $\theta$ from a set of observations $\{x_1, x_2, ... , x_n\}$ of the [[random variable]] $X$, find this unknow parameter $\theta$ is the main objective of the puntual estimation

To the set of all possible values that a parameter can take in a statistical model or probability distribution. we call the parameter space (also know as parameter set or parameter domain), denoted as $\Theta$
