Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) is a mathematical formulation used to find solutions to certain optimization problems where constraints must satisfy a complementarity condition. once we set it up as a mathematical optimization problem, We can apply various algorithms to compute [[Nash equilibrium]] , the most famous one for 2 players games is due to Lemke and Howson.
