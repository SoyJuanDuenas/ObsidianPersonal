The Borel [[Sigma Algebra]] on a space is constructed to include all sets that can be defined in a meaningful way using the basic open sets of the space. For the real line $\mathbb{R}$, which is the most common setting, the Borel [[Sigma Algebra]] is denoted as $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$. The elements of $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ usually are called Borel sets in $\mathbb{R}$, measurable Borel sets or Borelians of $\mathbb{R}$

Formally, the Borel Sigma Algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) = \sigma(\mathcal{O})$$

Where $\mathcal{O}$ represents the collection of all open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ this is formally expressed as:$$\mathcal{O} =\{(-\infty , x ] : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$$and $\sigma(\mathcal{O})$ is the [[sigma algebra]] generated by these open intervals.

# Characteristics

$\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ has the following characteristics:

1. $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is a [[Sigma Algebra]]
2. $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$
3. $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is minimum, this means than if $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[Sigma Algebra]] of a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) \subseteq \mathcal{A}$

# Key Properties

**Sigma Algebra**: $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is a [[sigma algebra]], meaning it includes:

- **Countable Unions**: If a sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, then their union $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$​ is also in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$.
- **Countable Intersections**: If a sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, then their intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n$​ is also in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$.
- **Complements**: If a set $A$ is in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, then its complement $A^c$ is also in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$

**Generated by Open Intervals**: It includes all sets that can be formed from open intervals through countable unions, intersections, and complements. This means it includes not only open intervals but also closed intervals, single points, and more complex sets.
   
**Smallest Sigma Algebra Containing Open Sets**: $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is the smallest sigma algebra that includes all open intervals. Any sigma algebra that contains all open intervals must also contain $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$.
  
**Measurability**: This sigma algebra allows for the definition of measurable sets, which are necessary for defining probability measures. A [[probability measure]] assigns probabilities to these measurable sets in a consistent way.
