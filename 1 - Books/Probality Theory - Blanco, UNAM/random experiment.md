#probability 

**Definition:**
A **random experiment** is a process or action that leads to one of several possible outcomes, where the result is uncertain and determined by chance. Each performance of a random experiment can result in different outcomes, and the exact outcome cannot be predicted with certainty before the experiment is performed.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Uncertainty:** The outcome of the experiment is not known in advance.
2. **Repeatability:** The experiment can be repeated under the same conditions.
3. **Outcome Set:** The set of all possible outcomes is known, even if the exact outcome is not.

**Examples:**

1. **Tossing a Coin:** When you toss a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Each toss is a random experiment because the outcome is uncertain.
2. **Rolling a Die:** Rolling a standard six-sided die has six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Each roll is a random experiment since any of the six numbers could appear.
3. **Drawing a Card:** Drawing a card from a shuffled deck of 52 playing cards is a random experiment with 52 possible outcomes, each corresponding to one of the cards.

**Importance in Statistics:**

Random experiments are fundamental in the field of probability and statistics. They provide the basis for defining and studying random variables, probability distributions, and statistical inference. By analyzing the outcomes of random experiments, statisticians can make predictions, estimate probabilities, and infer properties about larger populations or processes.

**Terminology:**

- **Sample Space ($\Omega$):** a [[sample space]] is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
- **Event:** A subset of the [[sample space]]. An [[event]] represents one or more outcomes of the experiment.
- **Probability:** A measure of how likely an event is to occur, typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
