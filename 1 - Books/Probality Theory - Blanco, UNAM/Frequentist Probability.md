# Definition

Frequentist probability, also known as the [[Classic probability]] or frequentist interpretation of probability, defines the probability of an event as the long-run relative frequency with which the event occurs in repeated independent trials under identical conditions. One of the principal disadvantages of this approach is we cannot make reproduce $n$ infinity times.

### Key Concepts

1. **Relative Frequency**: The probability of an event $A$ is the limit of the relative frequency of $A$ as the number of trials $n$ approaches infinity. $$P(A) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{Number of times } A \text{ occurs}}{n}$$
2. **Objective Interpretation**: Unlike subjective interpretations of probability, frequentist probability is based on objective, empirical observations. It relies on actual or hypothetical repetitions of an experiment.

### Examples

- **Coin Toss**: The probability of getting heads in a fair coin toss is 0.5. According to the frequentist interpretation, this means that if we were to toss the coin a large number of times, the fraction of times heads appears would approach 0.5.
- **Die Roll**: The probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die is $\frac{1}{6}$​. This implies that in a large number of rolls, the proportion of rolls resulting in a 3 would approach $\frac{1}{6}$​.

### Properties

1. **[[Law of Large Numbers]]**: As the number of trials increases, the observed relative frequency of an event will converge to the true probability of the event.
2. **Objective Measurement**: Probabilities are derived from empirical data and experiments, making them objective and reproducible.

### Visualization

Frequentist probabilities can be visualized using histograms or bar charts that show the relative frequencies of outcomes from repeated trials of an experiment. Over many trials, the relative frequencies should stabilize around the true probabilities.

### Key Points

- Frequentist probability defines an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency over a large number of trials.
- It is an objective approach based on empirical data and repeated experimentation.
- Frequentist methods are foundational in many statistical procedures and scientific research.
