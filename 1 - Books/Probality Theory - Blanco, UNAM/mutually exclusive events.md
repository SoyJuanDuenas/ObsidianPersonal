# Definition

Mutually exclusive events in probability theory, are sets (or events) that cannot occur simultaneously. In other words, if one event occurs, the other cannot.

# Formal Definition

Two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive if their intersection is the empty set:

$$A \cap B = \emptyset$$

In probability terms, events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive if:

$$P(A \cap B) = 0$$
### Examples

- **Coin Toss**: When tossing a coin, the events "heads" and "tails" are mutually exclusive because the coin cannot land on both heads and tails simultaneously.
- **Die Roll**: When rolling a six-sided die, the events "rolling a 3" and "rolling a 5" are mutually exclusive because the die cannot show both 3 and 5 at the same time.

### Properties

- **Additivity**: For mutually exclusive events $A$ and $B$: $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$This property extends to any finite or countable collection of mutually exclusive events.
