## Variance in statistical learning 

Variance refers to the amount by which $\hat{f}$ would change if we [[estimate]] it using a different training data set. Since the training data are used to fit the [[statistical learning]] method, different training data sets will result in a different $\hat{f}$. But ideally the [[estimate]] for $f$ should not vary too much between training sets. However, if a method has high variance then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in $\hat{f}$. In general, more flexible statistical methods have higher variance.
