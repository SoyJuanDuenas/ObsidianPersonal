#microeconomics

When we talk about self interested agents we are talking about a concept in economics called rational agent, this concept are in the core of [[neoclassical economic theory]]. It stands to a entity (person, firm, country ...) who performs optimal actions based on some information.

A self interested agent has preferences, so each agent has a [[utility function]] it quantifies the degree of preferences across alternatives, it describes us how a feeling towards some possible events. For example if I like cold weather, the result of my utility function will be greater if the temperature are close to 15 Celsius than if are close to 25 Celsius. 

Is expected that self interested agents are going to maximize the expected utility.
