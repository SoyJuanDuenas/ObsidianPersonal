Pareto optimality is a concept from microeconomics and game theory used to describe an allocation of resources or outcomes in which no individual or preference can be made better off without making at least one other individual or preference worse off. 

This condition represents an efficient allocation, where resources cannot be reallocated to improve someone's situation without disadvantaging someone else.

In Game Theory framework this condition let us compare and say that the output of a [[Game]] is better than the output of another [[Game]]. For example sometimes, one outcome $o$ is at least as good for every agent as another outcome $o'$, but there is some agent who strictly prefers $o$ to $o'$. In that case is seems reasonable to say that $o$ is better than $o'$ this can also be called that $o$ **Pareto-dominates** $o'$.

We can define Pareto optimality if there is not other outcome that pareto - dominates $o*$, then $o*$ is pareto optimal
## Example

in the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] We can find a particular property where the [[Nash equilibrium]] is the only output that doesn't correspond to a pareto optimal equilibrium, this because we can find better output in cooperation.
