#GameTheory

Prisioner´s dilemma is a [[Game]]  where we have two prisoners which can either cooperate or defect. If they both cooperate, they get some payoff *a*, and if both defect, they get a different payoff *d*. Where *a* is greater than *d*.

But, if they miss coordinate and one of them cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets the lowest possible payoff *b* and the defector gets the largest possible payoff *c*.

This type of game generate paradoxical properties but is useful to understand the difference between [[Pareto optimality]] equilibrium and [[Nash equilibrium]] this because ............. COMPLETE
