#GameTheory

Games of pure competition are a type of [[Game]] where players have exactly opposed interests, for accomplish this statement the game mush complete the following characteristics:

- There must be precisely two players.
- For all action profiles $a \in A, u_1(a) + u_2(a) = c$ for some constant $c$ (one player's payoff is exactly the complement of another player's payoff) and if c = 0 we can call the game zero sum [[Game]]
- Thus, we only need to store a utility function for one player because we only have to think about one player's interests.
