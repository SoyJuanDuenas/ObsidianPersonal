A map is a drawing or representation of the real world. It relates to spaces both within and surrounding a specific location, illustrating what exists in a particular area and the spatial relationships between various objects or features present there.

When creating a map, we aim to develop a simplified version of the real world. Maps serve a specific purpose, which means that someone must make deliberate decisions about what to include and what to leave out. These decisions are guided by the map's intended use, whether it be for navigation, scientific research, education, or any other purpose. As such, every map is both a reflection of reality and a product of selective emphasis, designed to communicate certain information while omitting other details.
