Spatial econometrics is part of [[Lattice Data]]. When introducing [[spatial statistics]], we realize that traditional econometric analysis may not be sufficient since it often exhibits spatial auto correlation. Therefore, we require new analytical techniques. We build upon the well-known linear regression model and add terms that explicitly model spatial dependence with neighboring regions also called [[contiguity]]. This approach allows us to identify different spatial effects, such as the spillover effect, and address the issue of spatial auto correlation among the model variables.

Spatial econometrics finds applications in various fields, especially:

- Biology
- Political Science
- Climatology
- Medicine and Epidemiology
- Urban Planning and Economics

## Spatial Effects

Spatial effects are the main reason for having a distinct field of study between econometrics and spatial econometrics. The primary spatial effects are:
### Spatial Dependence

In most empirical exercises applying regional science, the data contains spatial or spatio-temporal characteristics, i.e., spatial data. Spatial dependence can be seen as the existence of a relationship between what happens at one point in space and what happens in another location. This may be caused by two main factors: first, an error term in observations from a neighboring spatial unit (spillover effect), and second, the presence of some natural spatial interaction in human behavior.
### Spatial Heterogeneity

Spatial units tend to be far from homogeneous; for example, urban areas have populations with varying income levels, and regions have different degrees of technological development. These heterogeneities can lead to high errors due to incorrect specification or the absence of relevant variables, resulting in [[heteroscedasticity]].
