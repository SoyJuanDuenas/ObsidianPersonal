Spatial statistics introduces the spatial location of observations, meaning that we work with georeferenced data. If we recall Tobler's First Law, "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things," we realize that when conducting spatial analysis, we will need different tools than traditional ones. Within spatial statistics, we encounter three main areas of knowledge:

- **[[Geostatistics]] / Geostatistical Data:** Geostatistics focuses on the analysis and modeling of changes in continuous variables associated with spatial information. In this branch, we have measurement points over time, and we attempt to estimate how the variable behaves at other nearby points.

- **[[Point Patterns]] / Point Patterns:** This type of analysis studies the distribution of the location of a series of events in a specific region. For example, cases of a disease in a city or the distribution of each tree species in a forest. Typically, point pattern analysis seeks to determine if the occurrence of events is uniform (or random) in space or if events appear more or less frequently in some locations.

- **[[Lattice Data]]:** In this type of analysis, we know the location of all events of interest or at least aggregated in a study region, and therefore, we analyze them individually. Generally, we use regression models that model the correlation between neighboring variables.

## Spatial Data

Spatial data can be defined as information that represents the position of a point or area in space with the attributes associated with this information. Spatial information is associated with a point or an irregular polygon (area) or regular configurations (lattice).

These data have two-dimensional location vectors, including a third vector for altitude. From this, we can identify spatial point patterns regarding the occurrence or absence of an event.
